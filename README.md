# PyLoader

## Introduction

This is a **.asi** plugin that allows writing custom Python scripts for GTA SanAndreas. This plugin is still in the early stages of development so, if you find and bugs or have feature suggestions let me know :\) 

**Python version**: 3.10x

This is a rewrite of the original [PyLoaderSA](https://github.com/user-grinch/PyLoader/tree/master) with support for GTA3, GTAVC & GTASA. Goals for the rewrite are [here](https://github.com/user-grinch/PyLoader/issues/1). Not ready for actual use yet!
